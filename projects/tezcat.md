[Tezcat](https://uhmanoagamedev.itch.io/tezcat) is a 2D dungeon crawler inspired by games like *Soul Knight*, developed by members of the UH MƒÅnoa Game Dev club. The game features procedurally connected rooms, item-based exploration, and combat-focused mechanics.

My primary contribution was building the **inventory system logic** in C# using Unity. I implemented the backend structure for tracking player-acquired items, managing item pickup/drop functionality, and defining inventory constraints. While I did not design the inventory UI, my system provided the functional backbone that other team members used to integrate visuals and interactions.

**Key takeaways from this project:**
- Experience working in Unity with C# to implement modular, object-oriented systems
- Designing reusable game logic components for team integration
- Collaborating in a student-led development environment with version control (Git/GitHub)

*Note: This was a collaborative team project. My role focused specifically on the inventory system‚Äôs internal logic and item management.*
